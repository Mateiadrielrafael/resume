= Hi!

My name is Adriel. I am 19 years old, and I study mathematics at the university of Groningen. I've been coding for about $6$ years, and I have a strong interest in type systems, compilers, and everything functional programming. I have about $1$ year of industry experience with PureScript (which is pretty much Haskell for the web), and I have spent the rest building numerous side projects.

I started learning Haskell & PureScript about $3$ years ago while working on Lunarbox --- a visual, strongtly-typed, color-coeded functional programming language. I originally started working on the project in TypeScript, then later migrated to Elm, F\#, and finally settled on PureScript. 

The functional programming model is the most intuitive to me, which makes the process of programming more fun. I put a lot of care into making sure I enjoy the tools I am using --- be it setting up a fun linux distribution like Nixos, coding in a hyper-customized Neovim, or even writing #link("https://github.com/Mateiadrielrafael/slambda")[my own custom keypress processing script]. Functional programming is just an extension of that mindset.

During the summer of $2022$, I was able to work full-time for #link("https://visonum.de/")[visonum], which helped me pay for the first year of my education. Furthermore, the opportunity taught me a lot of skills and provided me with valuable experience. 

I am looking to do the same during the summer of $2023$, and your company looks like a perfect fit. Furthermore, I can consider part-time work once the summer ends.

Can't wait to hear back from you!
