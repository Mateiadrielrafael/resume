= Hi!

My name is Adriel. I am 19 years old, and I study mathematics at the university of Groningen. I've been coding for about $6$ years, and I have a strong interest in type systems, compilers, and everything functional programming. I have about $1$ year of industry experience, and I have spent the rest building numerous side projects.

During the summer of last year, I was able to work full-time for #link("https://visonum.de/")[visonum], which helped me pay for the first year of my education. Furthermore, the opportunity taught me a lot of skills and provided me with valuable experience. 

I am looking to do the same during the summer of 2023, and your company looks like a perfect fit. Furthermore, I can consider part-time work once the summer ends.

Can't wait to hear back from you!
